# Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) Course

Welcome to the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) Course repository! This course not only provides a deep understanding of neural networks but also guides you through an end-to-end project.

## Course Overview

In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of artificial neural networks and their applications. Additionally, you'll have the opportunity to apply your knowledge to a real-world project.

## Contents

- Basics of Neural Networks
- Activation Functions and Neuron Models
- Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)
- Backpropagation and Training Strategies
- Applications of ANNs
- End-to-End Project


## Getting Started

Begin your journey by exploring the provided notebooks, code samples, and resources. For a hands-on experience, don't miss the end-to-end project that ties together everything you've learned.

## End-to-End Project: Predicting Housing Prices

This project guides you through the process of building, training, and evaluating an artificial neural network to predict housing prices based on various features. Follow the project folder for step-by-step instructions and practical exercises.
